HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY MY MAHA💖🦋
Happy birthday to the one who feels like home in human form.
You've been my loudest cheerleader and my quietest comfort.
Somehow, you always know when I'm breaking—even in silence.
With you, every memory turns golden, even the messy ones.
You've loved me without conditions, and that changed me forever.
When I forget who I am, you remind me with just a look.
Your heart is the softest place I've ever landed.
I'm endlessly thankful that life chose you for me.
No matter where life takes us—I'm there for you.
and don't be angry i don't like it 
Ne kova aha irudha nala ila , just smile .
I HOPE YOUR BIRTHDAY IS FULL OF LOVE AND EVERYTHING THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY AND SMILE🥰🥹
Happy Birthday Gopal🩷🤎🦋🫶🏻`;
